# Deep-feature-extraction-from-CNNs-followed-by-optimization-with-GA    

## Project Description
This is a python-based project classifying the type of breast tumor tissue into benign or malignant, based on deep analysis of histopathological image samples through the application of three popular Convolution Neural Networks, namely `GoogLeNet`, `ResNet-18`, and `VGG-19`, one at a time, followed by the extraction of deep features and optimization using the Genetic Algorithm (`GA`) for improved accuracy and classification using the `SVM`, `KNN` and `MLP` classifiers.

## Dataset description
The Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification (BreakHis) is composed of 9,109 microscopic images of breast tumor tissue collected from 82 patients using different magnifying factors (40X, 100X, 200X, and 400X). To date, it contains 2,480 benign and 5,429 malignant samples (700X460 pixels, 3-channel RGB, 8-bit depth in each channel, PNG format). This database has been built in collaboration with the P&D Laboratory â€“ Pathological Anatomy and Cytopathology, Parana, Brazil (http://www.prevencaoediagnose.com.br). The dataset is available at:
